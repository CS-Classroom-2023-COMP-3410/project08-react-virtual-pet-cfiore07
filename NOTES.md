This project doesn't work on github pages because of the following error I couldn't figure out:

"Loading module from “https://cs-classroom-2023-comp-3410.github.io/project08-react-virtual-pet-cfiore07/src/main.jsx” was blocked because of a disallowed MIME type (“text/jsx”)."

but does work to a limited degree in a docker container.

Features implemented:
Stat decay
Action Buttons
Sleep toggle
Status Bars
Mood
Activity
Growth Stage
Age
